/**
 * Interface for reflecting database schema metadata.
 * 
 * <p>This interface defines the contract for implementations that introspect
 * database schemas to extract table, column, and relationship information.
 * The reflected metadata is used by GraphQL schema generators to create
 * appropriate GraphQL types and resolvers.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Implementations are responsible for:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Discovering all tables in the configured schema</li>
 *   <li>Extracting column metadata including names, types, and constraints</li>
 *   <li>Identifying foreign key relationships between tables</li>
 *   <li>Filtering tables based on application configuration</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Implementations should be database-specific and annotated with
 * {@link io.github.excalibase.annotation.ExcalibaseService} for proper service lookup.</p>
 *
 * @see io.github.excalibase.model.TableInfo
