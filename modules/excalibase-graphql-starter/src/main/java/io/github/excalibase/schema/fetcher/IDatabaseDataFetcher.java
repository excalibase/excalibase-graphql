/**
 * Interface for creating GraphQL data fetchers for database operations.
 * 
 * <p>This interface defines the contract for implementations that create GraphQL
 * data fetchers responsible for querying database tables and resolving relationships.
 * Data fetchers handle the actual database interactions and data transformation
 * required to fulfill GraphQL queries.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The interface provides methods for creating different types of data fetchers:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Table data fetchers for basic queries with offset-based pagination</li>
 *   <li>Connection data fetchers for cursor-based pagination (Relay specification)</li>
 *   <li>Relationship data fetchers for resolving foreign key associations</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Implementations should be database-specific and annotated with
 * {@link io.github.excalibase.annotation.ExcalibaseService} for proper service lookup.</p>
 *
 * @see DataFetcher
 * @see io.github.excalibase.annotation.ExcalibaseService
