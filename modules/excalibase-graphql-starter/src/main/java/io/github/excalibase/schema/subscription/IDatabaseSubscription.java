 * Interface for creating GraphQL subscription resolvers for database operations.
 * 
 * <p>This interface defines the contract for implementations that create GraphQL
 * subscription resolvers responsible for providing real-time updates when database
 * table data changes. Subscription resolvers handle streaming data changes and
 * notifications for table modifications.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The interface provides methods for creating different types of subscription resolvers:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Table subscriptions for listening to table data changes</li>
 *   <li>Health subscriptions for monitoring system status</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Implementations should be database-specific and annotated with
 * {@link io.github.excalibase.annotation.ExcalibaseService} for proper service lookup.</p>
